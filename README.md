# Book Library

Book library web application which should be able to store books' information and track book reading.

## Current Status:

Under development.

## Motivation

Part of my journey learning to create web apps. This part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Javascript course.

## Development

### To-do:

- [x] UI development - clean, modern and fresh UI;
- [ ] Optional: Add dark theme;
- [x] Write a constructor for making “Book” objects;
- [x] Create a function to add books to an array;
- [x] Create a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page as a card;
- [x] Add "New Book" button to the page that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages and whether it’s been read;
- [x] Add a button and the functionality to the book card to remove the book;
- [ ] Add a checkbox and the functionality to the book card to change the reading status;
